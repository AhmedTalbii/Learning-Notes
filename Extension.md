# Extention (chrome | firefox)
Extensions are small tools that enhance your browser’s functionality. Here, I’ll document what I learn so I can refer back anytime. These notes are short, practical, and public, so anyone can quickly access useful tips and insights.

## Manifest.json
`manifest.json` is the main file of a Chrome extension. It’s the extension’s blueprint, telling the browser its name, version, permissions, scripts, icons, and how it should interact with websites and the browser itself. Without it, the extension won’t work.\
its json

```bash
{
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "name": "name of your extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "description of your "
    
}

```
